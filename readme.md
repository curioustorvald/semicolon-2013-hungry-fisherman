Something I have made back in highschool, as a part of a team, in 2013.

## Dependency

- TDBase.dll - some weird GDI-based framework that I have no idea how it works, not coded by me and don't have its source code. Can be replaced with any video game frameworks though.

## Quirks

- No version control system exists for this thing, I didn't even know what the hell was Git back then.
- DS_Store files: coded on my MBP with virtual environment to run Windows.
